Everything we need to know about python
 - Lambda Function => It is a python expression that allows to write anonymous functions.A lambda expression typically contains one or more arguments, but it can have only one expression.
 - [ lambda parameters: expression ]

 - Tuple : A tuple is a list that cannot change. Python refers to a value that cannot change as immutable. So by definition, a tuple is an immutable list.

 - Python Sorted => The sort() method sorts a list in place. In other words, it changes the order of elements in the original list.To return the new sorted list from the original list we have to use Sorted() function. That means Sorted() doesn't change the original list but reuturn a new sorted list. In term of Sort() it changes the original list and sort them in place.

 - reduce () => Python offers a function called reduce() that allows you to reduce a list in a more concise way.

 - List Comprehensions : [output_expression for element in list], [output_expression for element in list if condition]

 - dictionary {} : A Python dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is associated with a value. A value in the key-value pair can be a number, a string, a list, a tuple, or even another dictionary. In fact, you can use a value of any valid type in Python as the value in the key-value pair.

 - Example of dictionary : person = {
    'first_name': 'John',
    'last_name': 'Doe',
    'age': 25,
    'favorite_colors': ['blue', 'green'],
    'active': True
}

- Set() : A Python set is an unordered list of immutable elements.
      - Elements in a set are unordered.
      - Elements in a set are unique. A set doesnâ€™t allow duplicate elements.
      - Elements in a set cannot be changed.

- Frozen a set : To make a set immutable, you use the built-in function called frozenset(). The frozenset() returns a new immutable set from an existing one.
- Set Union:
