I will share all the necessary topics with description:

# Object
- An object is a container that contains <b>data</b> and <b>functionality</b>.

- The data represents the object at a particular moment in time. Therefore, the data of an object is called the state. Python uses attributes to model the state of an object.
- The functionality represents the behaviors of an object. Python uses functions to model the behaviors. When a function is associated with an object, it becomes a method of the object.In other words, an object is a container that contains the state and methods.
